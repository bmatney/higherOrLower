# higherOrLower

This is the first app built using Android Studio following the tutorial "The Complete Android N Developer Course". On launch a random number between 1 and 20 is chosen by the app. It will then check whether a number entered by the user is higher or lower than the chosen number and will tell the user to go higher, lower, or if they are correct.
